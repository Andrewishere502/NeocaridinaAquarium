# NeocaridinaAquarium
Describes a standard setup for an aquarium intended for Neocaridina shrimp.


### Why is this on GitHub?
I wanted a centralized location for describing a standard for setting up a 10G aquarium
for culturing _Neocaridina davidii_ shrimp as part of my Automated Neocaridina Aquaculture
project.
